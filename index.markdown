This project aims to develop a shared research agenda for computer-aided assessment of university mathematics, drawing on input from the community of mathematics education researchers and university teachers interested in this topic.

## Scope
The scope of possible research questions is broad, but has limits. In particular, questions should directly relate to computer-aided assessment of university mathematics:

* **Computer-aided** – relying on technology in a fundamental way;
* **Assessment** – concerning formative or summative assessment, rather than teaching or learning tools (though of course the line between these and formative assessment is blurry);
* **Of university mathematics** – based on topics or task-types which are relevant to mathematics as studied university.


## Question criteria 
When filtering and prioritising questions, participants will be asked to bear in mind the selection criteria used by Alcock et al. (2016, p24-25): 

> the eventual questions should: 
>  - address an important gap in knowledge; 
>  - be formulated specifically (not as a general topic area); 
>  - be clear, where appropriate, about specific interventions and outcome measures; 
>  - be answerable specifically (not by "it all depends"); 
>  - have a factual answer that does not depend on value judgements; 
>  - be answerable through a realistic research design; 
>  - be of a scope that could reasonably be addressed by a research team.
